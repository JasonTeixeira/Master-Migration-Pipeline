|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rehosting** (Lift & Shift) | Move applications to the cloud without changes.                                                     | Quick and easy to implement, minimal risk.                     | Misses cloud-native optimizations, potentially higher costs.   | AWS SMS, Azure Migrate, Google Migrate for Compute Engine, VMware HCX                                            |
| **Replatforming**        | Migrate with minor optimizations (e.g., use managed services).                                         | Partial optimization, uses some cloud-native features.         | Requires reconfiguration but not full refactor.                | Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon RDS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service                                          |

| **Repurchasing (SaaS)**  | Replace legacy systems with cloud-native SaaS solutions (e.g., Salesforce, Office 365).               | Reduces infrastructure management, lowers costs.               | Feature differences, retraining users.                         | Salesforce, SAP Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Google Workspace                                                  |
| **Retiring**             | Decommission legacy systems no longer in use.                                                        | Reduces cost and operational complexity.                       | Potential data archival needed, loss of historical systems.     | AWS Glacier, Azure Archive Storage                                                                              |
| **Retaining**            | Keep certain applications on-premises for future migration or due to constraints.                     | Avoids complex migrations, maintains current stability.         | Misses cloud benefits, defers cloud migration.                 | AWS Outposts, Azure Stack                                                                                        |
